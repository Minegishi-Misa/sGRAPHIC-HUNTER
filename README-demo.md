# sGRAPHIC-HUNTER single cell analysis
Code from Minegishi et al. (2022) - "Genetic optical labeling of neighboring cells interrogates cellâ€“cell interactions in metastatic niches." 


## System requirements
All code has been tested on R version 4.1.2 on MacOS 10.15 and 12.5. 


## Installation guide
Rstudio is downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/. 
The libraries required for the analysis are listed at the beginning of the R scripts. 
The typical install time is within 30 min. 


## Demo

####  Data analysis 
To download the data analysis code, git clone using the following command: 

    git clone https://github.com/Minegishi-Misa/sGRAPHIC-HUNTER.git


## Scripts 

HUNTER_hepatocyte-cancercell.R outputs figures corresconding to Fig.3, 4, and S13 to S15 in the manuscripts of Minegishi et al. (2022).

10x_liver-cell-analysis.R outputs figures corresponding to Fig. S10c. 

## 10x format data

10x format to be loaded in Seurat is available from https://riken-share.ent.box.com/s/r7noivs3qn33y1etalbr4lx9v0mltga8. 
The directories correspond to the respective samples as follows:

- TK10x-01-P: 10x data of hepatocytes havested from the liver transduced with N-GR

- TK10x-02-S: 10x data of non-parenchymal cells harested from the liver transduced with N-GR

Expected outputs are commented as corresponding figure numbers at the end of each analysis code. 
Execution of all analyses takes less than a few days.
SCENIC analysis takes the most time.
