# sGRAPHIC-HUNETR single cell analysis
Code from Minegishi et.al (2022) - "Genetic optical labeling of neighboring cells interrogates cellâ€“cell interactions in metastatic niches". 


## System requirements
All code has been tested on a R version 4.1.2 on MacOS 10.15 and 12.5. 


## Installation guide
Rstudio are downloaded from https://www.rstudio.com/. 
The libraries required for the analysis are listed at the biggining of the R scripts. 
Typical install time is within 30 min. 
All code execution is available as standard equipment. 


## Demo
The data to be loaded in Seurat was placed in Dropbox(). Also, the code for data analysis can be obtained via github. 
Expected output are commented as corresponding figure number at the end of each analysis code. 
Excution of all analyses require less than few days. SCENIC analysis require most time.  


####  Raw data
 All demultiplexed sequencing data have been deposited into the Sequencing Read Archive and are available for download under accession PRJNA841462.


#### Data matricics
Data matricics containing the matrix.mtx, features.tsv, and barcodes.tsv files are available from Dropbox().


####  Data analysis 
To download the data analysis code, git clone using the following command:
